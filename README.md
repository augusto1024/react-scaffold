# React Scaffold

This is a scaffold repo to start new projects. It contains multiple libraries that are usually installed in a new React project (or at least the ones I work with).

## Notes

- Each commit adds different libraries
- Each commit updates the `App.tsx` component with a list of the newly installed libraries

## Installed libraries

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
